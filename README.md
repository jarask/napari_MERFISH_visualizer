# napari_MERFISH_visualizer
This is an in-progress interactive visualizing tool for exploration of MERFISH data.

It is based on the Napari-framework, and the functionalities are incorporated as widgets and custom callback functions.

Be aware that this project will be changed rapidly, and things might get broken...

This was developed as a part of my Master's Thesis "Software and analysis for MERFISH".
